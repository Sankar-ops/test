Application Objective:
   Delivering full-stack applications via Azure resources and application build and hosting via Github actions.


Application deployment infrastructure resources:

* Azure App Service: This is the place where my Angular frontend and Ruby on Rails backend-based applications are deployed with docker image.

* Azure Database for PostgreSQL: My application data will be stored in this RDBMS.

* Azure Network: The Azure app service and PostgreSQL will be connected to different subnets, but they can communicate via the same VNET.

* Blob Storage: The front-end application part of assets will be uploaded here.

* Azure CDN: Azure storage account will be mapped to Azure CDN, which can deliver your static assets via cache. CDN URL links can be defined inside HTML pages. 
 

Use Case :
  When I browse my application through a URL at the same time, my application's static contents will be loaded via CDN. 
and it will move the load away from the app server.


Application Build  :

* create Docker file
* Build Docker image 
* push to acr via  Azure Workload Identity Federation ( passwordless Authentication )
* Deploy Docker image to Azure App service
* If required, pass below environment variables and connection strings to Azure App service

   > DB conntion string ( retrive value from Azure keyvault or Managed identity)
   > ACR credentials (retrive values from Azure keyvault)
   > Stoareg account connection string (retrive from Azure keyvaultor Managed identity)

This can be Achieved via Github actions



infrastructure Build :

   i have provisoned Above Azure resources with private communication method except Azure storage account and Azure CDN
 This was provisoned via Github Actions Pipeline.
